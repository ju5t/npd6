<a name="npd6---neighbor-proxy-daemon-ipv6" class="anchor" href="#npd6---neighbor-proxy-daemon-ipv6"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>npd6 - Neighbor Proxy Daemon IPv6</h2>

<p>A Linux daemon to provide a proxy service for IPv6 Neighbor Solicitations received by a gateway routing device.</p>

<h2>
<a name="summary" class="anchor" href="#summary"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Summary</h2>

<p>This Linux daemon will permit a device to respond to IPv6 Neighbor Solicitations based upon a configured address prefix, irrespective of whether or not those addresses are directly know or not.</p>

<h2>
<a name="linux-ipv6" class="anchor" href="#linux-ipv6"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Linux IPv6</h2>

<p>There's agap in Linux's IPv6 support. For a Linux device acting as a router (as a gateway does by definition) before it will respond to Neighbor Solicitations for inside-devices, they must be <em>statically</em> configured into the box. </p>

<ul>
<li>Typically, IPv6 addresses will be allocated by devices in an entirely non-static way. So knowing what addresses are in use in your private net is a non-trivial task to start with.</li>
<li>Configuring them in is fiddly, and a maintenance nightmare.</li>
<li>It doesn't scale. If you had a couple of IPv6 devices in the home-net, well maybe. But what happens when you have a few dozen? And their addresses change? And you have guest devices appearing and disappearing? </li>
<li>Linux support is still primitive, even for a static config. For example, you can configure IPv6 addresses for which we must act as a Neighbor Proxy, but, currently, you cannot <em>inspect</em> them to check. (No one believes this when they first hear it...)</li>
</ul><h2>
<a name="solution" class="anchor" href="#solution"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Solution</h2>

<p>What such a situation needs is, at its simplest, the gateway device to act as a simple proxy, answering Neighbor Solicitations for (potentially) <em>any</em> address with the assigned 64-bit prefix. In the simplest form I want my gateway, if it receives a Neighbor Solicitation for <em>any</em> address that starts with the prefix, to reply with a Neighbor Advertisement, irrespective of whether or not that device <em>actually</em> exists on my net: let the traffic arrive and have normal routing mechanisms decide if they can actually forward it.</p>

<p>And thus npd6 was born. There's more to it, of course, than that simple description. But, in essence, that's what npd6 does - answer Neighbor Solicitations for (potentially) <em>any</em> address with a defined prefix with a Neighbor Advertisement.</p>

<h2>
<a name="key-features" class="anchor" href="#key-features"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Key features</h2>

<p>At the time of writing, npd6 is in a fairly advanced, usable state. Key aspects and features include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Extensive optional debug output.</li>
<li>Very low usage of CPU and memory.</li>
<li>Logging to a file, or stdout/stderr or via syslog.</li>
<li>Ability to log a record of targets received.</li>
<li>Config via a text file.</li>
<li>Blacklisting or whitelisting if required.</li>
<li>Black/whitelisting based on static addresses or pattern matching.</li>
</ul>
